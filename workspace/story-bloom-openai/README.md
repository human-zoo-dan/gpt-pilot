# Story-Bloom-OpenAI

Story-Bloom-OpenAI is a Node.js application script that utilizes MongoDB and OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate and store storytelling content. The app is designed to stimulate creative writing and support various genres of storytelling on digital platforms.

## Overview

The app interacts with a MongoDB database for storage and uses the OpenAI API to generate various components of a story, including categories, titles, and plots. Furthermore, the appâ€™s structure follows the module pattern, encapsulating each function into its distinct module. This makes the code maintainable, scalable, and aids in easy deployments with Docker.
